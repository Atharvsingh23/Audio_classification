# Audio_classification
This project focuses on building a Machine Learning pipeline for audio classification, covering everything from data exploration → preprocessing → feature extraction → model creation and evaluation

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify audio signals into predefined categories (e.g., speech, music, environmental sounds) by leveraging signal processing techniques and ML models.

The workflow includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding dataset distribution, audio lengths, class balance, and spectrogram visualization.

Preprocessing – Cleaning audio signals, handling noise, trimming silence, normalizing sample rates.

Feature Extraction – Extracting meaningful features using:

MFCCs (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients)

Spectral Centroid, Bandwidth, Roll-off

Zero-Crossing Rate

Chroma features

Model Building – Training and comparing ML models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

Neural Networks (optional for deep learning extension)

Evaluation – Accuracy, F1-score, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve.

Visualization – Spectrograms, feature importance plots, and class distribution.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

librosa – audio analysis

numpy, pandas – data handling

matplotlib, seaborn – visualization & EDA

scikit-learn – ML models & evaluation

tensorflow/keras (optional) – deep learning models

📊 Results

Achieved XX% accuracy on validation set.

Random Forest and Gradient Boosting outperformed Logistic Regression.

Feature importance revealed MFCCs and Chroma features as key predictors.

🔮 Future Work

Extend to Deep Learning models (CNNs with spectrograms).

Deploy as an API or Web App for real-time classification.

Experiment with larger datasets (e.g., UrbanSound8K, ESC-50).
